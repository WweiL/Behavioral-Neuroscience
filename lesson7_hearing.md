# Hearing
## Sound
 - vibration of air molecules
 - we hear frequencies between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz

### Ascending Auditory Pathways
- `receptor -> brain stem -> thalamus -> cortex`
- It takes > 4 synapses to reach the porimary auditory cortex
- most other sensory systems take >= 3 synapses 

## Peripheral Auditory sysyem
1. `Pinna`(external ear) amplifies sound
2. Tympanic membrane ("ear drum")
3. `Cochlea`(snail): sound -> neural signals, filled with fluid, analyze the `frequency` of sound
4. Middle ear compensates for the loss of intensity as vibrations in air are changed(enters the fluid in the cochlea)

__ossicles__: amplify sounds

Middle canal contains the organ of Corti

Tonotopic map:
High frequency --> base of cochlea
Low frequency --> apex of cochlea

Organ of Corti: 3 Outer hair cells + 1 inner hair cell

`Afferent: information going into the brain`

## Transduction of Sound into Neural Signals
1. vibration
2. wiggle stereocillia
3. opens and closes K+ channels at the top of stereocilia
4. K+ enter, depolarize 
5. release neurotransmitter

## Pathway to the brain
1. Cochelea -> 
2. superior olivary complex -> 
3. inferior colliculus(midbrain) -> 
4. medial geniculate body(thalamus)
mostly controlessal(left ear -> right side of brain)
`cochlear nucleus(brainstem)`

## Superior Olive -- Sound Localization
= superior olivery body
Cues:
1. Arrival time(how fast the sound is)
2. Intensity(how loud the sound is)

## Neocortex
- Primary auditory cortex -> on the bank of the Sylvian fissure
- Wernicke's area: speech analysis
    damage(__Wernicke's aphasia__): can't analyze speech, can speak fluently but only nonsense words
- Broca's area: speech production(not part of the auditory cotex)
    damage(__expressive aphasia__): can read, listen, but can't say
