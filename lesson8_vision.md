# Vision

## Primary Viusual Pathways
1. Retina ->
2. Lateral geniculate nucleus(thalamus) -> 
3. primary visual cortex(occipital lobe)

## Structure of the Eye
- `Cornea` and `lens` focus the image on the retina
--'cataracts'(白内障), clouding of the lens
- `Iris` controls how much light enters the eye
- `Eye muscles` control where gaze is directed

## Refractive Errors
- Nearsightedness(Myopia)
- Farsightedness(Hyperopia)
- Astigmatism(cannot focus on one spot)
- Presbyopia: age-related condition in which the ability to focus up close becomes more difficult

## Structure of the Retina
- Receptors are rods and cones located at the back of retina
__Light meets retina ganglion neurons before it reaches the photoreceptors__(**)
- There are about 100 million rods and 4 million cones(photoreceptor cells)
- The output from the retina comes from 1 million retinal ganglion cells

### Cons (detect color)
sensitive to different colors of light(red, green, blue), which is the basis for the `trichromatic theory` of color vision

### Rods(detect light existence)
Poor color vision - primarily detect whether light is `present` of not

Color Vision - Opponent Process Theory
## Abnormal Color Vision
- Dirchromacy results from a missing or abnormal cone pigment
Sex: genes for red and green cones are on the X chromosome, higher prevalence in males
- Monochromacy: Having only one type of cone or absence of cones

## Receptive Field (at retina)
- Each sensory receptor cell or neuron responds to stimuli from a part of the world
- The retina ganglion neuron has a cneter/surround receptive field
- The receptive fled of ganglion cell is smaller than which of the cortical visual neuron

1. On-center/off-surround
ganglion neuron has the highest firing rate when light -> center
silent when light -> surrounding area

2. Off-center/on-surround
opposite to above

## Distribution of Rods and Cones
- Cones are mainly located in the fovea(center of retina)
- Rods are found mainly in the periphery of the retina
- Optic disk(where there is no rods&cones) is the anatomical basis of a blind spot
Nasal side(near nose)
Temporal side(opposite)

## The two types of Retinal Ganglion Cells
- Parvocelluar retinal ganglion cell (P retinal ganglion cell) 
 1. Receive input from cones
 2. sensitive to color
 3. respond to color difference
 4. input from cones in fovea
 5. `small` receptive field
- Magnocelluar retinal ganglion cell (M retinal ganglion cell) 
 1. Receive input from rods
 2. sensitive to black and white
 3. respond to light/dark difference
 4. inputs from rods in the periphery of the retina
 5. `large` receptive field

## Photopic system & Scotopic system
- Photopic system
     1. P retinal ganglion cells(>80% of ganglion cells)
     2. In the fovea
     3. good daylight vision
     4. acuity to see details
- Scotopic system
     1. M retinal ganglion cells(<20% of ganglion cells)
     2. In the periphery
     3. good night vision
     4. sensitive to see faint stimuli at night(changing in the sight)

(*)Macula: keenest vision

## Lateral Geniculate Nucleus
Retina ganglion neurons projects to the lateral genuculate nucleus of the thalamus
P cells and M cells goto different layers
P cells -> dorsal 4 layers
M cells -> ventral 2 layers

## Projections to the LGN
Each hemisphere receives input from both eyes
left hemisphere responds to right visual field
right hemisphere responds to left visual field
Nasal projection of left eye && Temporal projection of right --> right LGN

Only fibers from Nasal projection cross. (at `Opric Chiasm`)
temporal --> do not cross

    Left thalamus and visual cortex respond to light in the right visual field.
    Right thalamus and visual cortex respond to light in the left visual field.
right visual field: nasal of right eye && temporal of left eye (`light come from the right`)
left visual field: nasal of left eye && temporal of right eye(`light come from the left`)
Every sensory neuron has a receptive field.

## Primary Visual Cortex
LGN --> primary visual cortex(at the posterior tip of the occipital cotex)

### Receptive field in Primary Visual Cortex
#### Simple receptive field
        off-center, on-surround
        respond to specific orienation 
#### Complex Receptive field
        in a larger receptive field -- motion detection÷

## hierarchical organization
Dorsal projection && ventral projection (*)
ventral: "what"
Dorsal: "where"
area: not imp

### Ventral pathway damage(what)
 - visual-form agnosia(can't recognize shape)
 - Prosopagnosia(inability to recognize face)
 
### Dorsal pathway damage(where)
Unable to use visual cue to guide `motor action`
Can describe orienataion and shape of objects but cannot locate it. (like put an envenlope into  a mailbox)

### Hemifield Neglect
Neglect objects on one side of the body.
The side opposite to the damaged parietal lesion.
