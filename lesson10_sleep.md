# Sleep
## Reason
 - resotre energy
 - memory consolidation
 - clear out brain waste

## Sleep Measures
 - Electroencephalogram(EEG) __brain wave activity__
 - Electromyogram(EMG) __muscle activity__
 - Electrooculogram(EOG) __eye movement__

### EEG Stages of Sleep
Frequency: high(Awake) -> low(sleep)
Amplitude: low(Awake) -> high(sleep)
Awake: multiple neurons working(firing) -> high freq
Sleep: neurons inhibit.

Alpha, beta, theta wave: high freq, low amplitude
K-complex: sign of entering into delta wave(deep sleep)

After first sleep, stage 1 ~= REM sleep

### REM Sleep
 - rapid eye movement
 - Atonia(loss of muscle tone, relaxed)
 - Low amplitude
 - Cerebral activity increases to waking levels
 - General increase in the variability of autonomic nervous system activity
 - Muscles of the extremities(末端/手足) occasionally twitch
 - Types of dream during REM and non-REM differ: REM: story; non-REM: more abstract

| REM  | Slow-wave Sleep |
| --- | --- |
| EEG desynchrony | EEG Synchrony |
|   Atonia | moderate muscle tone |
| rapid eye movement | slow/no eye movement |
| limb twitch | sleep walking or talking |


### Sleep Deprivation
 - Impact performance and cognitive function
 - Related to development of `cancer`, `obesity`, `type 2 diabetes`

__Microsleeps__
   brief sleep periods <= few seconds
__REMs deprivation__
- Tendency to go into REM
- REM rebound
- Many impact brain development

Chroinc sleep loss impacts both glial and neuronal activity

### Neural Mechanisms
 - Reticular Formation
  located at the brainstem
  consists of multiple nuclei and nerve fibers
  controls major indices of REM sleep

### Neuralchemical mediation of sleep/awake
 - `serotonin` neurons (in the median raphé nucleus )
 - `norepinephrine` neurons(in the locus coeruleus) are highly active during aswke and inactive during sleeep (damage locus coeruleus -> become sleepy all the time)
 - `accetylcholine` stimulate a waking EEG rhythm(nicotin binds to accetylcholine receptors)
 - `histaminergic` neurons: high during waking but low during slow-wave and REM sleep
 - `Orexin` neurons(in the lateral hypothalamus) mediate arousal and sleep

#### Flip-flop model
 - Ventrolateral Preoptic Area(VLPOA): the main region that controls sleep
 Contains GABA(inhibitory)
 - The model: Either the sleep neurons are active and inhibit the wakefulness neurons
```
`Free Running Rhythm`: timing of activity and sleep does not always align with lightness and darkness of a day.
still predictiable

express free running rhythm: people who lack melanopsin expression in their retina ganglion neuron

damage of SCN: rhythm not predictable

blind(lack of photoreceptors) -> can still detect light

`sleep walking`: occurs during in deep sleep (can't be in REM because of atonia)
