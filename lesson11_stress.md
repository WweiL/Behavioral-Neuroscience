# Stress
Definition: Physsiological reaction caused by the __perception__ of aversive or threatening situations.
 - necessary for survival
 - adaptive( in some cases, maladaptive)
 - goal: restore homeostasis

## Physiology:
(barin)CNS && (bofy)PNS
Perception of a stressor
Different stressors activate different networks

### Physical stressors:
stimuli that produce actural disturbances of physiological states.
injury, infection
 - Processed by `brainstem` and `hypythalamic` regions
 - acticates specific systems that respond by relealsing hormones into the bloodstream

### Psychological stressors:
Stimuli that threaten the current state and are perceived in an anticipatory situation.
exams, incoming disasters, seeing predators
 - physical and cognitive stress responses
 - Activate `cortical(PFC)` and `subcortical(limbic system)` structures involced in `attention`, `learning` and `emotion`.

## Types of stress
 - Acute(short-term)
 requires immediate psychological adaptations
 e.g.:
    being chased by a line
    taking an exam
## Chronic(long-term)
 - substained stress
 e.g.:
    drought
    famine
    anticipation of a stressor(coming up exam)

## Pyhsiology of the stress response
#### Sympathetic adrenomedullar system(SAM) (comes first)
 rapid physiological response(fight-or-flight)
 fast in response but short in duration
 ### Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal(HPA) axis (comes second)
 Hormonal response
 slower in response (than SAM) but last longer

#### HPA Axis more detail:
coordinates the release of stress hormones
1. The `Hypothalamus` releases __corticortropin releasing hormone(CRH)__, which travels to the `Pituiary` gland
2. CRH triggers the `Pituitary` gland to release __adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH)__, which enters the __bloodstream__ to travel to the `Adrenal` gland.
3. ACTH triggers  the `Adrenal` gland to release __glucocorticoids__(e.g. cortisol) and other hormones such as __epinephrine__ and __norepinephrine__ into the blood.
4. Glucocorticoids are detected by the hypothalamus. If Glucocorticoids are too high, CRH production is reduced.(__negative feedback__)


## Glucocorticoids
Class of hormones that are involved in __glucose matabolism__, and are a critical component of the __physiological stress response__
`Cortisol` is the most well known glucocorticoid.
Bind to mineralocorticoid receptors(MR) and Glucocorticoid Receptors(GR)
Glucocorticoid Receptors are found throughout the brain
 - hippocampus
 - hyppthalamus
 - amygdala
 - cortex

can regulate gene expression
can affect many brain areas and brain functions

## Stress and memory
tightly related
__Acute stress can enhance memory, chronic stress can impair memory__

| Stress | Memory |
|---|---|
| Prefrontal cortex | Prefrontal Cortex(working) |
| Hippocampus | Hippocampus |

### Hormones during `acute stress` :
enhance memory
must be present __shortly after training__
- Epinephrine
- Norepinephrine
- Cortisol
#### How:
1. Enhanves function of the hippocampus and increase consolidation
2. increase the release of __glucose__ into the __bloodstream__, which enhance memory            

### Chronic stress
Impairs `explicit memory` but not `implicit memory`
Explicit memory: hippocampus
Implicit memory: basal ganglia
Chronic stress affects __hippocampus__.

Both releases glucocorticoids, how can it cause different results?
1. glucocorticoids binds to both MR and GR
2. it likes MRs better --> at low level, MR absorbs glucocorticoids
3. at high levels, glucocorticoids bind to GRs -> impairments of functions

##### Activation of MRs:
Enhances long-term potentiation -> enhance memory

##### Activation of GRs:
Impairs long-term potentiation -> impairs memory

## Neurobiology of chronic stress:
Supression of
 - Synaptic transmission
 - Long-term potentiation
 - Neurogensis(born of new neurons)
 loss of resillience
 inability to recover from stress
Increase in glutamate(too much glutamate kills cells), oxidative stress, inflamation

## Chronic stress in the brain
 - __Hippocampus__: Decreased dendritic branching and loss of dendritic spines
 - __Amygdala__: Changes in dendritic spines -- related to increased anxiety
 - __Prefrontal cortex__: Changes in dendritic spines -- related to impaired flexibility and increased vigilance(increased attention to surrounding area -> PTSD).

## Stress && Immune System
Impair immune function:
 Increased risk of infection during exams in medical students
