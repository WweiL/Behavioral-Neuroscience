# Biological Rhythms
    Circannual (yearly, migratory cycle)
    Infradian(> a day, menstrual cycle)
    Circadian(daily, human sleep-wake cycle)
    Ultradian(< a day, meals, sleep cycles)
    
    Zeitgeber: cues that synchronize biological rhythms(e.g. sunlight)
    Entrainment: the process of synchronizing a biological rhythm to an environmental stimulus
    
## Neural Mechanisms
### The retinohypothamatic tract
-- light signal(zeitgeber) is transmitted from a small population of retinal ganglion cell to the suprachiasmatic nucleus(SCN) of the hypothalamus.

-- ipRGCs
 - non-image-forming function but detect brightness
 - express melanopsin
 - loss of ipRGCs --> exhibit free running rhythm

### Suprechiasmatic Nucleus(SCN)
 - Circadian rhythm in the SCN
  1. Neuronal activity is measured by neurons take up more radiolabeled 2-deoxyglucose(marker)
  2. SCN is more active during the light period
 - Individual SCN fires rhythmically in a tissue culture
 - SCN neuron tells cells when to start/rest

##### SCN implant
 - SCN cell activity is genetically programmed
 - Lesions(damage) of the SCN lead to animals with arrhythmic acitity patterns
 - Transplant of embryonic SCN cells restores the circaidna rhythm
 
### Circannual Rhythm
 - Controlled by day length
 - Pineal gland
     secrets melatonin(褪黑素) at night time
    Seasonal changes because longer darkness in the winter
 - SCN is involved in Circannual Rhythm
 - Transplants of embryonic SCN cells `do not` restore the __circannual rhythm__(but restores the __circadian rhythm__)
 
### SAD(seasonal affective disorder)
 #### Winter SAD
  - sadness
  - decreased activity
  - increased sleep time
  - increased appetite -> weight gain
  - interpersonal difficulties
  - carbohydrate craving
  - improved with morning light therapy

which people will express an irregular biological rhythm?
People with lesions to the SCN(suprachiasmatic nucleus)
