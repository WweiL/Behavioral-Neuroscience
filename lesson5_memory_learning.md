# Memory & Learning
__Learning__:
- Process of acquiring new information
- Our experience change our nervous system
## Steps:
1. Encoding(learning)
2. Consolidation(memory)
3. Storage(memory)
4. Retrieval(memory)

__Patient HM__
cut hippocampus

## Amnesia
__Retrograte Amnesia__
Loss of old memory
__Anterograde Amnesia__
Inability to form new memory

HM - mirror test good -> long-term not effected

__There are differnet types of learning and are controlled by different memory systms in different brain areas__

hippocampus is not the location of long-term memories, short-term meories
but is involved in `consolidation of short-term memories into long-term memories`

## Types of Memory
### Sensory Memory (< 1sec)
- look at the screen, write stuff down
- automatic, don't need to think about it

### Short-term Memory(~ 1 min)
- working memory
- recall someting temporarlly(told something --> repeat)
- limited capacity

### Long-term Memory(life-time)
- multiple types
1. Explicit/Declarative (can explicitly state it)
 - Epsodic (events, party)
 - Semantic( knowledge, facts, definition of a word )
2. Implicit/Procedural( skill learning, conditioning, automatic, can't tell it)
 - Priming 
 - Skill learning()
 

## Brain Regions
1. Sensory memory - sensory cortex
2. Working memory(orange circle) 
### Explicit/Declarative memory:
###### Medial temporal hippocampal system
- Hippocampus
- Cortex surrounding the hippocampus
`formed` by the __medical temporal hippocampal system__ but `stored` in the __cortex__.
### Implicit/Procedural
- Basal ganglia
- Prefrontal cortex
- Amygdala


## Molecular mechanisms of memory formation(1 question)
Experience can change the structure and function of individiual neurons
Training can increase the number of new neurons and also change the cortex.

### Structual changes
- Increase/decrease in dentritic branching
- Increase/decrease in the number/density of dendritic spines
- Change in the shape of dendritic spines


#### The synaptic plasticity `hypothesis`:
Memory persists because synapses can be modified by experience.
`LONG TERM POTENTIATION`:
long-term increase in excitability of neuron caused by repeated high-frequency activation of that input.
Occurs through strenghthening of synapses.
glutamate

#### The NMDA glutamate receptor
unique properties
accept glutamate
Contains a Mg2+ ion in the Ca2+ channel
Requires slight depolarization to remove the Mg2+ before opening the Ca2+ channel.

#### How is synapse strengthened?
1. Actication of other receptors causes depolarization, expelling Mg2+ from the NMDA
2. Glutamate binds and Ca2+ enters the dendritic spine theough the NMDA receptors. Ca2+ ions activate enzymes in the spine.
3. Activated enzymes causes AMPA(binds glumate) receptrors to move into the spine
4. An increased number of AMPA receptors in postsynaptic membrane strengthens the synapse.
