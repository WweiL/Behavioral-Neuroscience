# Aging
## Defination
|Early   | 18-30  |   |
|---|---|---|
|Middle   | 38-47  |   |
|Late middle   | 48-59  |   |
|Old   | > 60  |   |

Nun study (x)

## Challenges
Cross-sectional vs. longitudinal design
(compare young and old) (people across time)

__Sample bias__
where the participants are taken from
- If samples are taken from `care facilities`, it may over-estimate those with deficits
- If study require travel to a unversity setting(to the research lab), it may over-estimate those without deficits(some may not be able to come, thus bias)

Age cannot be manipulated - results are correlational

Separating `normal aging` from `disease aging`

## Barin Aging
The brain is more sensitive to aging as the rest of the body
__Howerer, it is more sensitive to oxidative damage__

Accumulation of cell damage overtime

Involves changes in `neurons` and `gila`
(that slide is not imp)

## How does memory change?
Decline:
1. short-term memory
2. Epsodic long-term memory(events in self and other's life)
3. working memory

Some memories almost do not fade in aging
1. Semantic memory
2. Autobiographical memory(only own life story)
(declines very late in life)

Older individuals may use __different strategies__ to perform a task.  
-- make up for some deficits in brains
 
## Executive function & attention
Age-related decline in executive functino is likely related to age-related declines in `cognitive flexibility`, `reasoning` and `preocessing speed`.

Declines in memory & executive function are often described as linear, starting after 20.

## Cognitive Load & Aging
- At low cognitive load, few age-related deficits
- At high cognitive load, age-related deficits emerge
(e.g. do two things at once)

## Changes in __brain structure__
Significant changes in the `volume` of gret matter(cell bodies) and white matters(myelinated axons)
(losing neurons, but synapses are strenghened)

### Gray matter
Cortival thinning
- Decrease in the size of neurons 
- Reduction in synaptic spines
- Reduction in synapses

Superior parietal and inferior temporal cortex

### White matter
decrease --> "Slows down"
Loss in the __prefrontal cortex(PFC)__ & __anterior(front) corpus callosum__
PFC also 

__`(Important)`__
1. Changes in the frontostriatal(frontal cortex, basal ganglia) system(higher order cognitive process)
- Decreased dopamine, noradrenaline(norepinphrine) and serotonin
- Decreased volume and function of prefrontal cortex(PFC)
- Loss of white matter integrity in memory circuits associated with frontostriatal system
- Decreased activation of PFC in regions associated with complex taske; increased activation when performing __"easy"__ taske (compensation?, use two hemisphere to perform simple whie younger adults only use one)
- __Part of `normal` aging

2. Changes in temporal cortex(not the part related to auditory)
- Decreased volume in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus
- __Occur during the progerssion of the alzeheimer's desease__

## Other changes
- Increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier --> allows molecules into the brain that should not be there
- Increased activation of the immune system(brain has its own immune system) & imparied clearance of
misfolded proteins --> affect brain function
