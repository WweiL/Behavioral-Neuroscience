# Cells of the nervous system
Two main cell types: neurons and glia ( at least 3 types )


### Neurons
- Dendrite (tree) - reveive information(chemical) from other neurons
- Soma (cell body) - basic cell machienary
- Axon (long cable) -
- Axon hillock (small connection part between Axon and Soma)
- Terminal Buttons(connects to other neurons with dendrites of other neurons)
- Myelin sheath (covers axon)

corpus colleusum (axons covered by myelin sheath)

# Imformation Processing
Electrical signaling and Chemical Signaling
### Electrical signaling
- Action potentials
- Excitation
- Inhibition

### The Cell Membrane
Exacellur(outside of neuron)/intracelluar(within neuron) contains ions
K+(potassium), Na+(sodium), Cl-

Diffusion(chemicals move from higher concentration to lower concentration)

Electrostatic pressure

Contains `ion` channels
- Voltage-gated (electrical)
- Ligand-gated (chemical)

#### The Resting Potential
Outside of the cell: more Na+ and Cl-
Inside: More K+

The `inside` of a neuron is `negatively` charged relative to the outside
`Resting membrane potential = -50 ~ -80 mV `

#### The Action Potential
begins at the `axon hillock`
Travels down the axon
When reaches the terminal buttons, the action potential triggers the release of neurontransmitters

##### The process:
1. Na+ channels opens, Na+ enters the cell
2. K+ channels open, K+ leaves
3. Na+ channels becones `refractory`(can't open), no more Na+ enters
4. K+ continues leaving cell, causing membrane potential to return to resting level
5. K+ channels close, Na+ channels reset
6. Extra K+ outside diffuses away

##### Properties
1. All-or-none: the action potential, once initiated, always occurs
2. Always the same: the action potential is always the `magnitude/size` and `shape`
(varies a littble bit from neurons and neurons), (same: epalsed time, magnitude)
Reason: The action potential is `regenerated at each point along the axon`
        like a wave, swing a rope
##### Regeneration of the action potential
Na+ entries the cell body and diffuses, depolarizing adjanct parts.

Na+ to the terminal button, back to the cell body, kick off the action potential, Na+ channel become inactive for a short time
=> does not move backwords

##### Refractory Peroids(inactive time)
1. Absolute refractory period (action potential `cannot` occur)
1 millisecond
happens because Na+ channels are closed
Neuron `cannot` regenerate another action potential => prevents from crazily generating action potential, in the graph, goes up to infinity
Result: maximum of 1000 action potentials per second
About at period 3

2. Relative refractory period
3-4 ms
Hard to generate, but not impossible
About period 5

##### Conduction Velocity
varies, and is affected by two factors:
1. Axon thickness (up tp 35 m/s)
thicker -> faster because there are more ions
2. Myelination
Myelin also speeds up the conduction

#### Saltatory Conduction in Myelinated Axons
4x faster than unmyelinated axons
Axons insulated by `myelin`:
- Schwann cells in the PNS
- Oligodendrocytes in the CNS
##### Saltatory Conduction
Current flows to the next `Node of Ranvier` so the action potential 'jumps' from node to the node.

The action potential degrateds a little(but it is still above threshold) underneath the myelin. `At the next Node, it is regenerated.`

Action potential happens at the gap, and unerneath the myelin it does not happen at all(Na+ channels never open) and Na+ just diffuses.
