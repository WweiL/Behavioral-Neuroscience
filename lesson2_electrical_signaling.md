# Synapse
THe gap between the presynaptic terminal(terminal button of one neuron) and the postsynaptic spine(the dandrite of the other neuron)
#### Three parts
##### 1. Presynaptic membrane
 - sends the signal(release neurotransmitter)
 - vesicles
###### The process
1. Action potential reaches synaptic terminal
2. open voltage-gated `calcuum` channels, Ca2+ enters the terminal
3. Ca2+ causes synaptic vesicles to bind to presynaptic membrane
4. Vesicles burst open and release contents
##### 2. Postsynaptic membrane
###### The process
1. Neurotransmitter diffuses across cleft and binds to receptors
2. Neurotransmitter becomses unbound
 - reuptake(recycle) into vesicles
 - Enzymatic degradation(降解)

##### Receptors
- __Type 1. Ionotropic receptor__
(lingand-gated ion channel; fast)
neuron transmitter binds -- channel opens -- ions flows in
3 types: K+, Na+, Cl- => alter the __local membrane potential__
- __Type 2. Metabotropic receptor / G protein-coupled receptor__
slow
neurotransmitter binds -- G protein activated -- G protein moves to adjancent ion channel -- ion channel opens
There could be many types of G proteins -> varieties
The complex of the neuro system

##### Postsynaptic potentials
A neurotransmitter binds to the receptor, causing ions to move into/out of neuron
__Excitatory Postsynaptic potentials (EPSP)__
`depolarization`, toward threshold of excitation

__Inhibitory Postsynaptic potentials (IPSP)__
`hyperpolarization`, away from threshold of excitation

In reality, neurons is constantly receiving input from multiple neurons. It has to `integrate` these signals.
- net effect of EPSPs and IPSPs
- closer to axon hillock -> greater power
e.g. 12 EPSPs + 12 IPSPs -> cancelled out, no action

### Neurotransmitter
__nuclei__: Neurons that are similar in function that can be clusered into groups
__projections__: cell body may be located in one area and send axons to another. These axons are projections.

Neurotransmitter / hormones
some neurontransmitters can be hormones
short distance / long distance

When referring to a neurotransmitter system, '-ergic' is added
Dopamine -> Dopaminergic (systems / cells)
Acetylcholine -> cholinergic

1. __Amino Acids__
- Glutamate
    Excitatory -> increase cell activity
    released throughout the brain
- GABA
   Inhibitory
    released everywhere in the brain

Too much excitation: `cell death`, `seizures`

2. __Acetylchcholine(ACh)__
`Primary neurotransmitter secreted by axons of the PNS`
`Muscle contraction`, `movement`, `attention`, `learning`, `memory`
Several areas contains AChs:
bu kao: (Two clusters: botton front of the brain, set in the brainstem
send projections/axons to hippocampus => important for learning & memory
to cortex -> important for attention)

3. __Dopamine(DA)__
Three major areas contains DA neurons:
- Nigrostriatal
 from: __substantia nigra__ (black substance)
goto: __striatum__ (another word for basal ganglia)
- Mesolimbic
from: __mesencephalon__ (in the brain stem)
goto: __limbic system__
- Mesocortical
from: __mesencephalon__ (in the brain stem)
goto: __cortex__
attention, problem solving, executative function
first part: where cell part is located, second part: where those axons go( where DA is released to )

`movement, planning, problem solving, reinforcement, attention`
Degeneration of DA neurons in a specific brain region --> `Parkinson's disease`

4. __Norepinephrine(NE)__
Cell bodies in `brainstem`
attention, arousal, sleep
neurotransmitter && hormone

5. __Serotonin(5-HT)__
Cell bodies in `brainstem`
Fundtion: `mood, feeding, sleep, arousal, pain`
__Antidepressant medications typically increase levels of serotonin__

### Endogenous(produced or released within the body) __opioids__（鸦片）
- play a role in reinforcement and pain
- Receptors found in: `limbic system`, `thalamus`, `brainstem`
- Examples: endorphin, dynorphin


### Endogeneous cannabinoids (大麻)
- Receptors found throughout the brain
- Act as __retrograde messengers__: released and bind to presynaptic receptors and affect the presynaptic neuron
