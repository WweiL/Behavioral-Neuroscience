# Stress and trauma related disorders
## PTSD
higher in females than males  
fear conditioning: learned one trial; resisitant to extinction
Neuroanatomical studies:
1. `Lower hippocampal volume` <-> higher probability of having PTSD after traumatic events.
cause or consequence? not clear yet
children: might have PTSD with different symptoms as adults'

2. `Prefrontal cortex`
After PTSD: reduced volume in somae part of prefrontal cortex
Functional change in: prefrontal cortex, insular cortex(monitoring body states)
, amygdala and hippocampus

Freafal face: amygdala with enhanced activation and prefrontal cortex with reduced activation.

#### Treating PTSD:
__No__ available treatments to prevent the __formation__ of PTSD

SSRIs -> drugs, better than placebo

Behavioral:
Exposure therapy
