# Drugs and behaviors
## Drug
`Definition`: Any substance that althers the physiology of the body, excluding nutrients considered to be related normal functioning(like water, foods, etc.).
```
Prescription（处方） vs. over the counter(非处方)
Psychoactive drugs: drugs that affect feelings, thoughts, perceptions, or behavior. --> to brain
``` 
### Principles of Pharmacology
`Pharmacokinetics`: study of how a drug moves around the body.
- `Absorption` : how a drug gets into the blood (e.g. intramusucular injection(flu shot))
- `Distribution`: where a drug goes in the body
- `Metabolism`: breakdown of a drug (mostly in the liver)
- `Elimination/Excretion`: how the drug is broken down and leaves the body(broken down to become in different forms)(mostly in the kidney)

#### How fast a drug get into the bloodstream?
#### __influence factors__:
- Route of administration
- Chemical composition of the drug. e.g. lipid-solubility(脂溶性)
__All drugs have multiple effects.__

#### __Effects of repeated administration__:
`Tolerance`: decrease in the effectiveness of a drug that is administered repeatly.
`Sensitization(reverse tolerance)`: increase in the effectiveness of a drug that is administered repeatly. (e.g. cocaine)
`Withdrawal`: appearance of sympotoms __opposite to__ those produced by drug when a drug is administered repeatedly and then suddenly no longer taken.

#### __Agonism vs. Antagonism__
Drugs that __facilitate postsynaptic effects__ are called __agonists__
=> release and accept more neurotransmitters
bind to an active postsynaptic receptors(mimic the neurotransmitter itself)

Drugs that __blocking/inhibiting postsynaptic effects__ are called __antagonism__
- prevent storage of neurotransmiitter in vesicles
- inhibit release of neurotransmitter
- bind to and block postsynaptic receptors

### Principles of Reinforcement
`Reinforcing`: 
- Positive reinforcement: __addition__ of a stimulus(drugs) increses the behavior(e.g. drug-taking). => addition of good 
- Negative reinforcement: __removal__ of a stimulus(anxiety) increses the behavior(e.g. drug-taking). (take drugs that remove anxiety --> anxiety removed --> taking more drugs)
(can cooccur)
=> removal of bad

Cognition is an important part of substance use.
- Associating stimulus and reinforcing properties
- Expectations(someone tells that you would be ... after taking the drug)
- 
#### __Substance use disorders__
or addiction
diagostic criteria:
- Problems controlling intake
- Continued use __despite__ bad outcomes
- Development of __tolerance__ and __craving__
- Development of __withdrawal symptoms__
- Repeated attemps to quit

#### Addition/reward pathway
Ventral tegmental area(VTA) -> send to axons -> the nucleus accumbens(NAC)
Drugs trjgger the release of `dopamine` in the NAC

#### Brain mechanisms of addition
sailent
"Surprise" -> dopamine
The primary addiction/reward oatgwat consists of dopaminergic projections from VTA->NAC

Brain regins implicated in substance use disorders:
- Basal ganglia(striatum)
- Limbic system
- cirtex
__Receive `dopamine` and other neurotransmitters__

Early phases, pleasurable effects of durgs reinforce(`Positive rein`), which activates the __ventral striatum__
learning aspect of addiction
Later phases, becomes a habit. Dorsal striatum -> habit (ride a bike) 

#### Commonly abused drugs
Sedatives (supress central neuro activity)
- __Alcohol__
    most common
    sex difference
    Low dose -> happy feeling, release of anxiety
    Higher doese
    Reinforcement: 
```Positive: mild euphoria```
```Negative: Tremination of ```
    Neuropharmacology:
        goes through membranes easily
        primary sites:
            Agonist at GABA receptor (opens receptor and ion channel)
            Antagoinst at glutamate receptor(memory)
- __Sedatives: Barbiturates / Benzodiazepines__
Drug effects:
- anti-anxiety
- sedation
__Sedatives: Opiates__
effects:
- Pain relief
- Reduced heart rate
- Cough suppressant
- Reduced body temperature

In the brain:
1. Bind  to opioid receptores; (different subtypes with different actions) not imp
2. Cause the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens

__Stimulants: Nicotine__
Effects:
- Increased heart rate
- Elevated blood pressure
- Increases breathing

In the brain:
Bins to a subtype of acetylcholine receptor(nincotinc receptor)
Cause the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens

__Stimulants: Cocaine & Amphetamines__
Drug effects:
- Increased heart rate
- Vasodilation
- Increased body temperature

in the brain:
`DIRECTLY` increase dopamine(only ones) by affecting reuptake(block reuptake, prevent recycling -> combine more often -> more dopamine)

__Stimulants: Caffeine__
- Drug effects:
- Increased heart rate
- Increased blook pressure

In the brain:
Antagonist at adenosine receptors(higher levels of adenosinie induce sleep, blocks receptors of adenosine -> blocks sleep)

__Other: Cannabis__
Drug effects:
- Euphoria
- Relaxation
- Altered cognition

In the brain:
Bind to cannabinoid receptors
Increase the release of dopamine in nucleus accumbens

__Other: PCP / Ketamine__
hallucinogens -- alter mental states, can produce hallucinations
Ketamine: used in surgery as an anesthetic; short-term for treatment of severe depression
                                            long-term: schizophrenic-like symptoms
In the brain:
Glutamate receptor antagonist(like alcohol)
Dopamine receptor agonist
