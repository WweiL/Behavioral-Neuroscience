# Disorder
## Stroke (CVA)
1. Hemorrhagic
caused by repture of a cerebral blood vessel
2. Ischemic
caused by occlusion of a cerebral blood vessel(more common in adults)

## Traumatic Brain Injury
1. Open head 
Damage to brain region(like penetration)
2. Closed head
Also damage(like blunt)

can affect neurons, axons, blood vessels

#### Chronic traumatic encephalopath(CTE)
 - Form of TBI
 - Neurodegeneration due to head trauma
__Symptoms:__
    - Memory Loss
    - Impulsivity
    - Aggression
    - Imparied judgement
    
resemble Alzheimer's

`tau``, a protein accumulates and can't be cleared, in the temporal lobe

### Parkinson'Disease:
movement disorder characterized by abnormal voluntary movements
Motor sympotoms related to __lack of movement__  and __involuntary resting tremors that diminish when individual initiates movement__.
##### Neurobiological:
Destruction of a dopamine cells in the substantia nigra.(project to the striatum -- role in movement)

 - Parkin
 Protein that plays a role in transporting defectice of misfolded proteins to proteasomes
 mutates parkin is the cause of familial PD
 - Proteasome
 responsible for destroying defective or degenerated proteins within the cell
 - Ubiquitin
 Protein that attaches itself to faulty proteins

##### Treatment:
increasing dopamine
L-Dopa: precursor for dopamine
temporaily relieve symptoms, but after becomes ineffective
Surgical procedures:
stimulate globus palidus
### Huntington's Disease
movement disorder charactedized by excessive `involuntary` movements.
Genetic disease begins in 30s and 40s
No treatment
progressive: death in 10-15 years

Nrurobiological basis:
Degeneration of the basal ganglia
GABA producing neurons dies. 
reduces inhibitory control of the premotor and supplementary motor areas. -> involuntary movements.
results: abnormal huntingtin protein

### ALS
Degenerative disorder that attacks spinal cord and cranial nerve motor neurons; progressive
In some cases is genetic, gene that regulates glutamate.

Treatment:
drug that reduces glutamate

### Multiple Sclerosis
Autoimmune demyelinating disease
Symptoms:
 - wide variety of neurological symptoms
 - Early in disease, symptoms appear and disappear
 slightly more common in women than men; geographical: people who spend childhood in places far from the equator are more likely

Neurobiological:
    Immune system attacks myeline sheath at scattered locations.
Treatment:
    - Interferon beta -- mudulate immune system
    - Glatiramer acetate: mixture of synthetic peptides
    provide some relief but don't stop

### Dementia
caused by several disorders
failure of cognitive ability:
 - declines in episodic memory
 - Impaired retrieval and recognition
 - ..
### Alzheimer's Disease
Involves drastic failure of cognitivi ability that results from degeneration of brain tissue.
__Impaired memory:__
 - Episodic memory
 - Semantic memory
Impaired retrieval, recognition

Grey matter decline:(cell body)
affects prefrontal, parietal and temporal cortex;
but occipital, primary motor and sensory cortices often preserved

white matter(axon, connection): not affected much
Acetylcholine

What causes atrophy?
Accumulation and abnormal folding of proteins
 - beta-amyloid plaques -- extracellular
 - tau -- intracelluar
 - -> degeration of synapses

### Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders
range of defects caused by ingestion of alcohol by pregnant women
##### Brain changes:
 - Prefrontal cortex: attention and executive function
 - Cerebellum - motor and cognitive function
 - Hippocampus - memory
 
Animal tests:
 - Reduced cell numbers in hippocampus
 - Impaired long-temp potentiation
 - Reduced adult neurogenesis
 - Changes in many neurotransmitter systems: acetylcholine, glutamate, GABA, dopamine
 
### Down Syndrome:
extra 21st chromosome
Characterized by moderate-to-severe mental retardation
oftern accompanied by physical abnormalities

Chromosome 21:
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Alzheimer's disease
epilepsy

Brain changes:
 - Reduced volume and neuronal density in cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum
 - Impaired GABA neurotransmission
 - Development of Alzheimer's around 30-40s

### Autism Spectrum Disorder:
Chronic disorder
 - Failure toã€€develop normal social relationship with others
 - Impaired development of communication
 - Repetitive, stereotyped movements
 Brain:
 - size: 
  1. At Birth, silghtly smaller
  2. by 2-3, 10% larger than avg
  3. Adolescence 1-2% larger
  - Frontal & temporal cortices: grow quickly during first 2 years, little from 2-6 years
  - Amygdala: larger at 4 years but same size
  - Reduced activation of brain regions involved in social information processing
   Orbitofrontal Cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala
  - Changes in oxytocin signaling
